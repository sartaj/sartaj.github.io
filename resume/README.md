# Resume Generator
I made this resume generator because I didn't want to use Adobe to make my resume.

## Key Features
* Check out `src/`. This app uses only ES6 Templates for rendering, no framework needed.
* Check out `style/`. This designed as print first css, and the pdf generated is directly from webkit browser's print page. All CSS classes are based on print media.
* Simple Model-View architecture to allow for easy changing on content.


## TODO
* Add generated HTML for static view
* Switch divs to semantic HTML
* Make page jumps automatic
* Add filter capabilities with print capabilities.
* Completely abstract data from generator.
